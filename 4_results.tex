\section{Results}

\subsection{CAN-FD bus partitioning}

{\color{red} Calculations on bus load for 2 and 3 buses}

\subsection{CAN-FD interface performance}

{\color{red} Benchmark of CAN-FD speed, make sure it performs as well as necessary (from calculations)}

\subsection{Ethernet speed}

{\color{red} Benchmark Ethernet interface bandwidth. Calculations showing wether it is able to transmit all data from CAN-FD buses over telemetry}
