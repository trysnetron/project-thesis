\subsection{Power supply}

As with all electronics, you will have to supply it with energy for it to work as intended. In the scenario being explored in this paper, we have a SoC-based system and want to transition to a SoM for faster prototyping and iteration, we need to make sure that the power supply circuitry that was previously employed for the SoC is capable of handling a SoM. We will explore two methods for determining the applicability of an already existing power supply, simulations and analyzing an assembled circuit.
