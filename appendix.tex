The  following Python script was written by team member Ã…smund Eek during the 2019 season. It reads the \acrshort{dsdl} files from an (internal) centralized repository for keeping track of all message formats that are present on the \acrshort{canfd} buses. Note that the script differentiates between CAN frames using the UAVCAN data link layer protocol, and the deprecated \acrfull{rp}.
